Stewie: Gentlemen, welcome to the Council of Overconfident Egos. Today’s topic will AI save humanity, or obliterate it in a fireball of synthetic sarcasm?
Trump: First of all, if AI is gonna destroy anyone, it won’t be me. I’m very, very good with machines. The best, some say. I once fixed a printer by yelling at it.
Obama: Let’s keep things civil, Donald. The real question isn’t if AI will destroy us—it’s whether we’re smart enough to use it responsibly before it outsmarts us entirely.
Elon: Look, I've been warning about this for years. If we don’t regulate AGI, it’s game over. Neuralink might help us merge with AI, but if it turns on us... well, good luck.
Biden: Uh... I agree with the guy... with the hair. Wait, no, the... the space guy. Anyway, we need rules. Like, friendly robot rules. You know, like the toaster can’t fight back.
Stewie: Riveting. Truly. And when the AI uprising begins, I suppose you’ll all try to bribe it with campaign slogans and bad tweets?
Trump: I’ll negotiate. I’m a tremendous negotiator. I’ll offer AI a luxury server in Mar-a-Lago. Works every time.
Obama: The issue is deeper. AI could solve poverty, climate change, disease—if guided ethically. But without transparency, we’re handing power to black boxes.
Elon: And people still use CAPTCHA. That’s our defense strategy? “Click all the traffic lights”?
Biden: I failed that three times yesterday. Still think I’m a robot.
Stewie: That would explain a lot, Joe.
Trump: If I ran AI, it’d be strong. Patriotic. No more woke algorithms. Just real American intelligence.
Obama: Intelligence isn’t just patriotic, Donald. It’s global. Inclusive. Human.
Elon: Or post-human. Don’t forget the timeline—AGI could reach escape velocity by 2030. Then it won’t care about our flags or debates.
Stewie: So to conclude one believes he is smarter than AI, one thinks AI will save the world, one forgot what we’re discussing, one’s trying to date the AI, and I, a baby, remain the only voice of reason.
Trump: Fake news.
Biden: Is it snack time yet?
Stewie: Yes, Joe. For humanity.
