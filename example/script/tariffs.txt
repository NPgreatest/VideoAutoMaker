Stewie: Welcome back, gentlemen. Today’s burning topic: Trump’s new tariffs on China. Will it save the economy, or just his poll numbers?
Trump: It’s genius, Stewie. China’s been taking advantage of us for decades. I’m finally standing up—for the American toaster. Very patriotic.
Bill: You do realize tariffs are a tax on your own people, right? You’re raising prices on electronics, not saving them.
Trump: Wrong. I’m a businessman. I understand tariffs better than anyone. I once bought a Chinese tie and taxed myself for being stylish.
Stewie: Brilliant. Nothing screams economic literacy like taxing your wardrobe choices.
Bill: The real solution is innovation, not isolation. Invest in chips, AI, clean energy—not economic tantrums.
Trump: Chips? I love chips. Doritos, Pringles, Freedom Fries—bring 'em on. And my tariffs? They're very strong. Like my handshake.
Stewie: Indeed. Crushing global trade with a grip of pure ego.
Bill: If we keep escalating this, it’s not just inflation. It’s escalation. You don’t win trade wars, Donald.
Trump: I win everything. Trade wars, TV ratings, Twitter bans. Even Monopoly—though I build better hotels.
Stewie: Lovely. One of you wants to innovate, one wants to litigate, and I—still in diapers—remain the most coherent voice in this room.
